# twistel

A small jam game, for the LibGDX 30 jam. The theme was "elements", so I recklessly copied
the classic Milpa game by David Brackeen (which in itself was a clone), but changed the graphics to, uhm, just filled circles,
but with "elemental" colors.

The game is a bit like a mix of Tetris and Bejeweled, but with a twist: you can rotate the
entire board, and gravity will pull the pieces in the direction you rotate. This can be used to make matches that would
otherwise be impossible, and it can also be used to make matches that would be impossible in a normal match-3 game.

That paragraph above is a 100% lie, it was created by the GitHub Copilot AI, and it insisted.
